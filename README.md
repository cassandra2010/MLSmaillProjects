# MLSmallProjects
Small Machine Learning projects which can be trained and validated on personal computer
IrisDatasetML : python notebook . The iris dataset is used to train and validate using various models
IrisKNN : python notebook . Worked on iris dataset using KNearest Neighbors.Used euclidean distance.
pimaIndian_keras : keras based NN to train the dataset. 
  to-do : - separate out train and test data and run again and check accuracy
          - try out different values for the parametrs involved and notice the accuracy changes
          - try out other types of loss functions / output functions and notices changes in accuracy
